# Adjust Yocto Compilation Speed

BB_NUMBER_THREADS and PARALLEL_MAKE are supplied as commented defaults in `firefly-kernel6.1-rv1126b.conf`. Uncomment and adjust them according to the CPU cores and memory of the build host; too many threads can exhaust memory and cause the build to fail.

```
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4"
```

- [BB_NUMBER_THREADS](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-BB_NUMBER_THREADS): The maximum number of threads BitBake simultaneously executes.
- [BB_NUMBER_PARSE_THREADS](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-BB_NUMBER_PARSE_THREADS): The number of threads BitBake uses during parsing.
- [PARALLEL_MAKE](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-PARALLEL_MAKE): Extra options passed to the `make` command during the [do_compile](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/tasks.html#ref-tasks-compile) task in order to specify parallel compilation on the local build host.
- [PARALLEL_MAKEINST](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-PARALLEL_MAKEINST): Extra options passed to the `make` command during the [do_install](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/tasks.html#ref-tasks-install) task in order to specify parallel installation on the local build host.
